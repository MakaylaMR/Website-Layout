# Web Contruction Fund. (CPNT260)
## Author/Creator: Makayla Martineau Raymundo
## Context
This website in simple terms shows off my Jeep and my partner's Jeep. This site includes; a hero section, a horizontal navigation bar that turns into a hamburger menu at small enough screen sizes, a contact section, a gallery, an interactive google maps and a footer.

## Requirements

You should expect the site to be completely responsive for any screen size.

### CSS
I have added comments in my css pages such as "body,header, nav bar, etc.." to help you navigate the css page.

In addition to those comments I have also added comments explaining the reasoning behind choosing certain css qualities. 

At the top of every css page I have added descriptions of what you can expect to find in each page.

The sections of the css page are in order of the html page where, body comes first, then header, then nav bar, the hero section and so on. However, for any media queries used, you will find them at the very bottom of the css pages.

### HTML
The HTML also includes comments, these comments explain any difficulties I had, or they might be comments on why I decided on certain HTML elements.
